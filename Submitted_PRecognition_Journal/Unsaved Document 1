In the previous century, deep learning has been introduced for the artificial intelligence program, but it is difficult to apply it in real cases because of the limitation of the resource at that time. In recent years, it has risen strongly because of improvements in computation performance. It has been applied to solve problems in different domains such as computer vision, speech recognition, or languages translation. Among different types of deep learning architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks have been most often used in computer vision for image classification, object recognition, or key points detection and they have brought amazing achievements. In this work, we propose a new Convolutional Neural Network model based on composition of elementary blocks, each elementary block is a sequence of layers, to predict key points (landmarks) on 2D anatomical biological images. Our proposed model has been trained and
evaluated on a dataset including the images of 3 parts of 293 beetles. During the experiments, the network has been tested in two ways: training from scratch and applying fine-tuning process. In the fine-tuning step, to lead the pre-training step, a large public dataset of key points on human faces has been used. The obtained parameters have been then inserted to re-train the model on beetleâ€™s images. The quality of predicted landmarks is evaluated by comparing
the coordinates distance between predicted landmarks and manual ones which have been set by biologists. The final results have been delivered to biologists and they have confirmed that the quality of predicted landmarks is statistically good enough to replace the manual landmarks for most of the different morphometry analyses.



In this work, we use a Convolutional Neural Network to predict the landmarks on biological images. So, the article could be classified both into recognition category or deep learning category.
