\begin{abstract}
Landmarks are one of the important concepts in morphometry analysis. They are morphological points that can be located precisely (e.g. corner of the eyes) and used to establish correspondence or divergence among morphology of biological specimens. Currently, the landmarks are mostly positionned manually by entomologists on numerical images. In this work, we propose a method to automatically predict the landmarks on entomological images based on Deep Learning methods, more specifically by using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We propose a CNN architecture, EB-Net, which is built in a modular way the concept of ``Elementary Blocks", each made up of usual layer types of CNN. After using a custom data augmentation procedure, the network has been trained and tested on a dataset of different anatomical part of carabids (pronotum, head and elytra). In this numerical experiment, we have generated two strategies to evaluate the network and to improve the obtained results: training from scratch or applying a fine-tuning step. The predicted landmark coordinates have been compared to the coordinates of the manual landmarks provided by the biologists. The statistical analysis of the distances between predicted and manual coordinates has shown that our predictions can replace efficiently manual landmarking and allows to propose automatization of such operation.

\section{Introduction}

In the context of ecosystem services, there is an interest in examining complex interactions between the evolution of insect populations and environmental factors affecting their functions. In order to assess specifically pest-regulating services and in line with studies pointing to shape traducing function \cite{klingenberg_evolution_2010}, there are more and more researches about beneficial insect morphometrics \cite{sasakawa_utility_2016,raymond_combination_2014}. 
 In such morphometric studies, it is common to analyze subject's shape independently of their poses and sizes \cite{kendall_diffusion_1977}. Since the late $20^{th}$ century \cite{bookstein_foundations_1982}, rooted in a strong statistical background, geometric morphometrics address the study of such biological shapes \cite{rohlf_applications_1998}. It is an effective set of methods with several specialised softwares readily available \cite{adams_geomorph:_2013,klingenberg_morphoj:_2011}. Classical geometric morphometrics uses a set of landmarks to describe shape, a landmark being a two-dimensional anatomically-relevant point. In order to investigate the possibility of automated morphometric geometrics on beneficial insects, we chose to focus on one of the most common and ubiquitous beneficial insect of north-western France, \textit{Poecilus cupreus} (Carabidae). It is considered a polyphagous predator \cite{larochelle_1990} beneficial to agriculture, being able to consume a large variety of agricultural pests including weed seeds, slugs and aphids \cite{kromp_carabid_1999}. As a Coleoptera, its morphological variability is usually measured on exoskeleton structures such as the head, pronotum and elytra \cite{eldred_does_2016}. 
 
Of course, the first step in any morphometric geometrics study is the digital imaging of the biological specimens with controlled illumination and contrasting background. As such, morphometric landmark detection and positioning can be though as a particular problem of features detection and solved using robust digital image processing \cite{gonzalez_digital_2006}. In the recent years, the term ``deep learning" emerged describing class of computational models composed of multiple processing layers learning representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction \cite{lecun2015deep}. Each layer extracts the representation of the input data from the previous layer and computes a new representation for the next layer. In the hierarchy of model, the lower layers take care of the primary features whereas the higher layers care for the abstract features to enlarge the aspect of input for the computational task (classification, regression, \ldots) and to suppress irrelevant variations. Deep learning algorithms have proved to be very efficient in a wide variety of domains, notably computer vision \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, ciregan2012multi, szegedy2015going, li2015convolutional,tompson2014joint}, speech recognition \cite{mikolov2011strategies, hinton2012deep, sainath2013deep}, question answering \cite{bordes2014question} and language translation \cite{sutskever2014sequence, jean2014using}.
Within deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are well known for their success in many computer vision tasks such as image classification \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet,ciregan2012multi} and  objets recognition \cite{li2015convolutional,tompson2014joint}.
Recent success of this algorithm in human biometry \cite{cintas2016automatic} lead us to believe in its potential for insect morphometrics.  

%As supervised learning algorithms, they use gradient descent optimization method to update the learnable parameters via backpropagation.

\subsection{Related works}\label{rw}
%In biology, landmarks could be divided into three types. Some landmarks are cleary defined on a structure (type I), others that are more ambigious and usually describe maxima of curvature (type II), and those that are geometric construction generated from lines (type III). In geometric morphometry analysis, the detection of landmarks in biological images is a necessary step in many researchs.

Landmark-based geometric morphometrics has been applied to a variety of research questions and applications in biology. The applications can be ranged from fossil human/dinosaurs \cite{rosas2015geometric, fearon2015morphometric} to butterfly/fly wings \cite{chazot2016morpho}, zebrafish skeletogenesis \cite{aceto2015zebrafish}, flower shapes \cite{van2010three}. They have been also concerned on medical imaging, e.g., cephalometry aims at analyzing the human cranium for orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning \cite{lindner2016fully, grau2001automatic}. 

Geometric morphometry analysis based on landmarks is mainly beginning by positioning the landmarks in two-dimensional images, which is typically achieved manually. Landmarks are then compared by employing various statistical methods to distinguish landmark variations or the changing of shape in large populations, e.g., Procrustes analysis. Depending on applications, the number of landmarks varies, it could be ranged from several to dozens of landmarks, for example, $15$ landmarks have been defined in a study on drosophila wing \cite{palaniswamy2010automatic} or $25$ landmarks have been used in a research on zebrafish \cite{aceto2015zebrafish, vandaele2018landmark}. Manual setting landmarks is time-consuming and difficult to reproduce. A solution that can automatically provide landmarks could be useful in these studies.

Recently, automatic prediction of landmarks has appeared in many applications of various domains: In computer vision, landmark localization is usually studied on human faces where we identify some points corresponding to significant parts on face, e.g., nose, eyes, mouth region \cite{burgos2013robust, yang2013sieving}. In biology, the landmark identification problem has been appeared in the studies to analyse shape and size on the organisms \cite{palaniswamy2010automatic, savriama2018step}, e.g., analyzing the corolla shape variation. In biomedical field, the problem of automatic landmark positioning has been addressed in cephalometry \cite{grau2001automatic, mohseni2007automatic}. The familiar methods in these domains are based on the combination of template matching and prior knowledge information after a step of the segmentation of interesting objects. Lowe et al. \cite{lowe2004distinctive} have proposed SIFT method to find the corresponding keypoints between two images. Palaniswamy et al. \cite{palaniswamy2010automatic} have proposed a method based on probabilistic Hough Transform to automatically identify the landmarks in digital images of Drosophila wings. In previous work \cite{le2017maelab}, we have proposed a method which was extended from Palaniswamy's method, to determine landmarks on beetle images. The experiments have been done on two sets of mandibles images which have an ordinary shape and are easy to segment. The obtained results were satisfying when comparing to the landmark's coordinates of the manual setting. Unfortunately, this method could not be provided the landmarks to other parts of beetles as pronotum, head, and elytra. The reasons have been found down that these pictures are not simply as mandible ones. They do not only contain the considered objects but also other parts of beetle because they have been captured before dissection. Also, shape segmentation has been a trap for our method.

In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in computer vision. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine the landmarks on 2D images has achieved good results. As was common, the CNN inputs raw pixels of the image, then it analyzes the relations between the pixels to predict the coordinates of landmarks. These operations are performed by a sequence of layers. It is worth to note we do not recognize the appearance of the segmentation step in the process. Thus, CNN has offered an effective solution to face images that have difficulty in segmentation. In the landmarking context, Yi Sun et al. \cite{sun2013deep} have proposed cascaded convolutional neural networks (three-levels) to predict the facial points of interest on the human face. Each level considers the face from global to local regions to determine the landmarks. Zhanpeng Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2014facial} proposed a \textit{Tasks-Constrained Deep Convolutional Network} to optimize facial landmarks detection. The model determines the facial landmarks with a set of related tasks such as head pose estimation, gender classification, age estimation, face recognition, or facial attribute inference. Cintas et al. \cite{cintas2016automatic} has introduced a network to predict the landmarks on human ears. After training, the network has the ability to predict $45$ landmarks on human ears. Based on our knowledge, CNNs have been widely used in biological applications but not to provide the landmarks. In this work, we proposed a CNN architecture to predict the landmarks on biological images, specific beetle's images.

\subsection{Contributions}
In this article, we detail a CNN architecture that we have designed to automatically set landmarks on beetle images, so-called Elementary Block Network (EB-Net). The prediction has been evaluated by comparing to the ground truth manually provided by biologists. We describe how we have applied data augmentation to remedy the problem of using machine learning algorithms on the small dataset. We will also outline how performance can be improved by using transfer learning from another dataset like human facial points.

\section{Material and Methods}
\label{sec2}
In this section, we first present the dataset that we have used in this study, as well as the strategies to pre-process the data. Then, we describe the designed network architecture to predict the landmarks in the beetle images.

\subsection{Dataset and preprocessing}
\label{subsec21}
In order to provide the experimental data, we have selected the Brittany lands (North-West of France) to collect the samples. After collecting in three months, a collection of $293$ beetles has been established ($147$ males and $146$ females/ $155$ organic and $138$ conventional) (Figure \ref{imgbeetle}). As usual, images of beetles have been chosen to be studied instead of using real objects for practical reasons. For each beetle, five images corresponding to five parts of beetles have been taken into account: elytra, pronotum, head, left and right mandibles. The pictures of each body parts were captured under a trinocular magnifier at $\approx 300$ pixels/mm for elytra, $\approx 600$ pixels/mm for pronotum and head, $1500$ pixels/mm for mandibles. One can note that the head, pronotum, and elytra parts have been captured before dissection. The left and right mandibles have been separated from the beetle's body before taking the photos. All the images have been taken with the same camera under same conditions to release in the RGB color mode with a size of $3264 \times 2448$ pixels.

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{An illustration of the beetle.}
	\label{imgbeetle}
\end{figure}

In the next step, morphological landmarks were first set manually on the dorsal views of each body part of the beetles (head, pronotum, elytra, right and left mandibles). The morphology of each body part was processed and analyzed separately in order to limit variation resulting from their relative positions due to articulation. Landmarks were chosen according to the ease and the precision of their location on each specimen (Figure \ref{figdatasamples}). Replicability analyses were performed to confirm the accuracy of landmarks positioning. They were positioned on each picture with TPSDig2 software (version 2.17) (Rohlf, 2013a). In some individuals, mandibles could not be processed because they were lacking or missing. For each specific part, a set of number of landmarks has been provided, for example, \textit{$8$ landmarks for pronotum, $10$ landmarks for head, $11$ landmarks for elytra, $16$ and $18$ landmarks for left and right mandibles, respectively} (Figure \ref{figdatasamples}). In the context of this study, these manual landmarks have been used as ground truth to evaluate the output of our method.

\end{figure}

The success stories \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, ciregan2012multi,  szegedy2015going} have proved that CNN models have to be trained on a large dataset with an enormous number of data samples before using the trained model to perform on testing data. Training the model with a big dataset can help the model able to learn more different cases and to improve the learning ability of the network. Unfortunately, providing a large dataset is too costly in several domains, e.g., in biology, medicine. A solution to deal with this problem is to create the misshapen data from real data and to add them to the dataset. In our case, we have only 293 images for each part of the beetles. This number is large from the point of view of manual operations, but it is not enough to apply deep learning methods. So, we have applied data augmentation process to face this problem.

Most often in deep learning applications, dataset augmentation uses operations such as translation, rotation, or scaling, which are well-known efficient to generate new versions of existing images \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, shorten2019survey}. In order to select the right method for our application, we have done some tests by moving the object in the picture. In each time, we have quickly gone to the over-fitting in the training step. Consequently, we have preferred other ways to produce misshapen images by operating on the image's color channels. We have proposed two strategies to augment the number of images in our dataset.%However, these operations can be invariant in some cases \cite{shorten2019survey}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \subcaptionbox{. Add a constant to each channel.}{\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{./images/inc_channels}}~~
\subcaptionbox{. Split the channels of image.}{\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{./images/sp_channels}}
    \caption{The two strategies to augment the number of images in
      pronotum set.a) illustrate the augmentation channel per channel
      by adding a constant value to each pixel on the corresponding
      channel. b) illustrate how to extract 3 different images from
      only one by selecting a color channel each time.}
    \label{figdataauge}
\end{figure}

The first strategy has been applied to change the value of each channel in the original image. According to this, a constant have been added to a channel of RGB image for each time. For example, if we add a constant $c = 10$ to the red channel from an original RGB image, we will obtain a new image with the values at red channel by greater than the red channel of original image a value of $10$. By this way, we can generate three new RGB images from a RGB image.

The second procedure was to split the channels of RGB images in order to create three gray-scale images. This work seems promising because the network model works on single-channel images. At the end, we have generated six versions from an image. In total, we have obtained $293 \times 7 = 2051$ images for each set of images. Figure \ref{figdataauge} illustrates the two described strategies.

To perform the objective, we have observed the input size of the several CNN models \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, ciregan2012multi, cintas2016automatic, sun2013deep} and noticed that most often their input sizes were limited to $256$ pixels. One can note that our images were released with the size of $3264 \times 2448$, as mentioned in Section \ref{subsec21}. This size is a bit heavy for training the network. Consequently, we have down-sampled our images to a new size of $256 \times 192$ to respect the ratio between width and height. Of course, coordinates of landmarks have been down-sampled to the new size of images. Practically, convergence is usually faster if the average of each input variable over the training set is close to zero \cite{lecun2012efficient}. So, the brightness of the image is normalized to $[0,1]$.% and the coordinates of the landmarks are normalized between $[-1,1]$ before giving to the network.

\subsection{Network architecture}
\label{subsec22}
Our initial trials were inspired by AlexNet architecture \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}. The model has been designed by combining in sequence the classical layers, e.g., convolutional (CONV), max pooling (POOL) and fully-connected (FC) layers. Unfortunately, over-fitting effects appearance very quickly. In deep learning models, it exists another type of layer, the Dropout (DROP) layer, which is well-known to prevent over-fitting \cite{srivastava2014dropout} and usually used in the last steps of the procedures. We
will present now the Elementary Block (EB) model which includes all
these layer types and is the core of our model
architecture.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{images/eblock}
	\caption{The components of an Elementary Block. Orange, yellow
        and green boxes contain the operations, blue boxes the data.}
	\label{figeblock}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figeblock} illustrates the order of the layers in an EB
item. It is defined as a sequence of a CONV layer, a maximum POOL
layer, and a Dropout layer. In an Elementary Block, the convolution
layer is used to extract the high-level features by applying different
filters on the input. Setting POOL layer after the CONV layer towards to reduce the spatial size of the representation to decrease the number of parameters as well as to use less the computing time. The DROP layer, usually inserted between the FC layers to prevent over-fitting \cite{lecun2015deep, krizhevsky2012imagenet}, is included in our model in the extracting feature blocks to produce some kinds of image noise augmentation. The DROP layer randomly drops some connections during the training process. It makes the network thinner than the original one (fewer parameters), so training a network with dropout layer is equivalent to train a set of thinner networks.

Three Elementary Blocks have been then assembled to create the whole network
architecture, called Elementary Blocks Network (EB-Net). The used
parameters of layers in EBs have been set as follows: the depths of
CONV layers are set to ($32, 64, 128$) with a small kernel
($3 \times 3$, $2 \times 2$, $2 \times 2$) from the first to the third
block, respectively. The POOL layers in all three blocks have been
designed with a filter of $2 \times 2$ and a stride of $2$
pixels. With these parameter values, the spatial size of the image
will be halved after every block. The probabilities of the dropout
layers are set increasing: $0.1, 0.2$, and $0.3$, respectively. In
order to extract the global relationship between the features and to
provide the prediction, three fully-connected layers have been added
after the combination of three EBs. The first FC layer takes all features
from the last block as the input for computing. The last FC layer
outputs the coordinates prediction of landmarks. The number of outputs
at each FC layers is set to $1000, 1000$, and $X$, respectively. The
number $X$ is equal to two times the number of landmarks that we want to
predict ($x, y$ coordinates). For example, to predict $8$ landmarks on
pronotum, the number of outputs of the last FC
layer is set at $16$. Additionally, a dropout layer with the probability equals to
$0.5$ has been inserted between the first and the second
fully-connected layers as usual 
\cite{hinton2012improving}. Figure \ref{figebnet} resumes the EB-Net
architecture.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{images/arch_model}
	\caption{Elementary Blocks Network (EB-Net) architecture
          obtained from a composition of 3 Elementary Blocks and ended
        by 3 Full Connected layers.}
	\label{figebnet}
\end{figure}

In a CNN model, besides the model-specific parameters which involve the structure of the network (e.g., the number of layers or parameter values of each layer), the optimized hyper-parameters are also important to design a CNN model also. These variables are related to the training of the network model, for example, the loss function, the number of epochs, the batch size, and the initialized value of learning rate. Practically, the range of the possible values is explored through empirical observations depending on the task and the dataset. In our application, we have chosen the most common optimization algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), like usual studies \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, cintas2016automatic}. In order to apply SGD, the two relevant parameters need to be provided: learning rate and momentum. In our application, the learning rate begins from $0.03$ and stops at $0.00001$, and the momentum rate is updated from $0.9$ to $0.9999$. During the training, learning rate and momentum are adjusted to fit with the number of epochs. For example, the learning rate and momentum at the first/the third epoch are $0.03/ 0.029994$ and $0.9/0.90001$, respectively. Besides, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been chosen as loss function because it is employed for regression problems where outputs represent quantitative values as the case of coordinates of landmarks. The EB-Net has been implemented by using Lasagne framework \cite{lasagne}, and trained in $5000$ epochs on Linux system by using a NVIDIA GPU (Titan X) card.

\subsection{Setting and training EB-Net}
\label{subsec23}
In order to provide the predicted landmarks for all images, we have applied cross-validation technique K-fold with $k=9$, to select the test images. We will call a selection step is a round. For each round, we take $33$ images for testing step, the $260$ remaining images are used to train and to validate the network model. It is worth to note that the set of $260$ images has been augmented by the strategies described in Section \ref{subsec21}, to provide $1820$ $(260 \times 7)$ images for training and validation steps. The cross-validation step has been achieved after $9$ rounds in total. 

During the training and validation step, the $1820$ images are randomly divided into training and validation sets with a ratio of $60\%:40\%$. At each training step, the pair of \textit{image} and
\textit{its manual landmarks} is inputted to train the network
model. In the testing step, we input the image only to the trained
model in order to predict landmarks. In our case, the manual landmarks have
been given by the biologists. So, they are used as ground truth to
train the network, as well as to evaluate the predicted ones.

\subsection{Statistical evaluation of predicted shapes}
\label{subsec24}
The quality of landmarks predicted by the network must be assessed in view of the desired usage for these predictions. It is quite frequent in geometric morphometrics to use the landmarks for subsequent procrustes regression \cite{adams_geomorph_2013} which is a method to quantify the relative amount of shape variations (among specimens) attributable to one or more factors in a linear model. 
Before the regression step, a generalized procrustes analysis \cite{adams_geomorph_2013} translates all specimens related landmarks to the origin, scales them to unit-centroid size, and optimally rotates them until the coordinates of corresponding points align at best. The resulting aligned coordinates represent the shape of each specimen. Afterward, the procrustes distance between specimens (i.e. sum-of-squared distance between corresponding landmarks) can be used for regression purpose \cite{goodall_procrustes_1991}. 
% One can note that using predicted landmarks instead of manual ones for procrustes regression will be a special case of Estimated Dependent Variable (EDV) models \cite{lewis_estimating_2005}. 
The crucial step that we can take to ensure the validity of using predicted landmarks for procrustes regression is a measure of shape covariation between predicted and manual landmarks \cite{rohlf_use_2000}. 
% This will be an insurance that the predicted procrustes distances are correlated between predicted and manula landmarks.
This problem is related to the construction of a latent variable of shape deformation and it goes further than studying, independently, each landmark correlation between predicted versus manual. Indeed, the landmarks are not independent to each other in their relative positions between specimens because they form a shape. Hence, we are looking for covariations between predicted and manual shapes that are positive, as high as possible  and statistically significant. 

\section{Results}
\label{sec3}
\subsection{The first evaluation}
\label{subsec31}
EB-Net has been firstly trained and tested on the pronotum images. Figure \ref{figdlosses} shows the losses of training and validation processes in one round on pronotum images. The blue curve is the training loss, and the green curve is the validation one. As we can notice, learning is effective and over-fitting does not appear. We can assume that EBs with the help of dropout layers have properly worked to prevent over-fitting.

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{./images/loss_v16}
    \caption{The losses during training EB-Net on pronotum images.}
    \label{figdlosses}
\end{figure}

Table \ref{tbltrainingloss} shows the losses of the $9$ rounds of EB-Net training on pronotum images. We can observe that although the image dataset changes through each round, the loss values remain stable and always under $3 \times 10^{-3}$. Based on the success of EB-Net on pronotum images, we have employed it on the two sets of head and elytra images with the same result qualities.

\end{table}

The quality of performances of a CNN is mainly measured from loss, accuracy. But in this work, we also need to appreciate correctly where the estimated landmarks are positioned by the network. So, the trained model of each round has been used to predict the landmarks in images of the corresponding testing set. Then, the coordinates of outputted landmarks are evaluated by comparing with the manual ones. Figure \ref{figeb1} illustrates the landmarks on the three parts of beetles. The red/yellow points present the predicted/manual landmarks. One can note that even some predicted landmarks are close to the manual ones, we have also some predicted coordinates that are far from the expected results.

    \caption{The landmarks on three parts of beetle. The red/ yellow points present the predicted/ manual landmarks.}
    \label{figeb1}
\end{figure}

In order to provide a global evaluation, the distances (in pixels) have been calculated between the manual landmarks and the corresponding predicted ones, and the average value at each position has been taken into account. Table \ref{tblavgpronotum} shows the obtained average distance for pronotum, head and elytra. With the image's size of $256 \times 192$, we can consider that an error around $1\%$ of image size ($\approx 2$ pixels) could be accepted. Unfortunately, our results exhibit the average distances from $4$ to $5$ pixels ($\approx 2\%$ of error).

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering	
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\textbf{Landmark} & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 \\ \hline
		\textbf{Pronotum} & \textcolor{green}{4.00} & 4.48 & 4.3 & 4.39 & 4.29 & \textcolor{red}{5.36} & 4.64 & 4.94 & - & - & - \\ \hline

	\end{tabular}
	\caption{The average distances per landmark on images of each set.}
	\label{tblavgpronotum}
\end{table}

It is worth to note that an average value could reflect several different cases, for example, the values closed together (small dispersion) or two sets of values very far (large dispersion). In order to see in which situation we are, Figure \ref{figprodist} shows the distribution of distances between the manual and predicted landmarks for the best and the worst cases in each set of images (the green and red values in the table). Each point presents the distance between the points (landmarks) of an image. The lines (blue/red) illustrate the average distance in each case. In both of two cases (the best and the worst), the distances are most often stay in the region from $0$ to the average value. Regarding these figures, it is clear that even a large number of points remains inside the range from $0$ to average value, some points are widespread between the average and $15$ or $25$ pixels. The question is: is it possible to lower the mean and to lower the dispersion above the meand value.

\subsection{Transfer learning to improve performances}
Working with deep learning requires not only to design a good architecture but also to provide huge dataset to train and to test the model. Practically, this is a potential problem in some application domains as in biology. In section \ref{subsec21}, we have augmented the number of images in our dataset and used it to train EB-Net. However, our number is far away several hundred thousand images. In this case, knowledge transfer or transfer learning between tasks could be an additional solution to improve the prediction.

Transfer learning is a technique in deep learning to re-purpose a model which has been designed for a specific task (source task) on another related task (target task) \cite{olivas2009handbook, yosinski2014transferable}. Choosing which strategy of transfer learning to apply depending on the relationship between two tasks, as well as the size of database. Practically, transfer learning is mostly targeted on $2$ strategies:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Use CNN as a fixed feature extractor}: Taking a CNN pre-trained on a large dataset, then removing the last fully-connected and using the rest layers of CNN as a fixed extractor for the new dataset.
	\item \textbf{Fine-tuning a CNN}: This scenario begins as the first strategy. However, it does not only replace and retrain the last layer but also fine-tunes the weights of the pre-trained model by extending the backpropagation. One can note that to reuse a pre-trained model, the parameters have to be adapted between the two tasks. These parameters could be the size of input images, the number of outputs, or the parameters of each layer.
\end{itemize}

In Deep Learning community, ImageNet is known as a large dataset with more than $14$ million images of thousands of categories \cite{deng2009imagenet}. Notable models have employed ImageNet as training data to solve different tasks \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, simonyan2014very}. These pre-trained models have been widely shared in deep learning community as a source to re-use the features of ImageNet dataset. As a preliminary work, we have tested several well-known models, e.g., AlexNet \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}, VGG-16 \cite{simonyan2014very} that have been trained on ImageNet \cite{deng2009imagenet}. Unfortunately, the features from ImageNet seem to be not relevant for our application because the image features mainly concern the detection of global shape of the objects whereas landmarks can be considered as local features \cite{lin2016homemade}. Fortunately, searching for landmarks is explicitly defined in other applications like face recognition, or facial key-points detection. Consequently, we have decided to continue with EB-Net to improve the quality of predicted landmarks coordinates.

\subsubsection{Pre-train EB-Net on facial keypoint dataset}
In recent years, several competitions \footnote{Deepfake Detection Challenge/ Facial Keypoints Detection} have been organized for predicting facial keypoints on human face, the training datasets have been freely published. We have decided to choose such facial keypoints dataset to pre-train EB-Net and then to transfer the parameters values to fine-tune them for beetle's images.

The selected dataset to pre-train EB-Net has been published for a challenge\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection} on the Kaggle website. It includes $2140$ images of human faces ($96 \times 96$ pixels). For each image, $15$ landmarks have been defined: $6$ landmarks for eyes, $4$ landmarks for eyebrows, $4$ landmarks for the mouth, and $1$ landmark for nose tip. Figure \ref{fighmface} shows $4$ examples of face images and their landmark positions in the dataset.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{images/face_dataset_2}
	\caption{The samples (face and manual landmarks) in the Kaggle
          dataset that we have used to pre-train EB-Net.}
	\label{fighmface}
\end{figure}

In order to use EB-Net on this dataset, we have adapted the parameters of the input and the output layers to match with the face images size and the landmark number. The new parameter values are $96 \times 96$ for the input size, and $30$ for the number of outputs of the last FC layer (corresponding to $15$ landmarks). For hyper-parameters, just the number of epochs have changed to reach the value of $10000$ epochs. In table \ref{tblRMSE_challenge}, we show the RMSE score and the comparison of the effectiveness between EB-Net and the three best ones that have been published for the challenge.

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{ | c | c | c | c | c |}
	\hline
	%\multirow{2}{*}{Team} & Olegra & Trump & Enes & \multirow{2}{*}{EB-Net} \\ \hline
%	  & $1^{st}$ & $2^{nd}$ & $3^{rd}$ &  \\ \hline
	Team & Olegra & Trump & Enes & EB-Net \\ \hline
	RMSE score (in pixels) & 1.2824 & 1.4004 & 1.4026 & \textbf{1.497} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}	
	\caption{RMSE comparison between our score and top three of challenge.}
	\label{tblRMSE_challenge}
\end{table}

It is worth to note that the three scores have been obtained by testing the models on a private set of images that are not freely available. To do the test, we have had to use some images getting from the public data set, $100$ images have been chosen to do that. Comparing with these scores, the three models present better results than us but we are very close. The RMSE score is around 1 pixel that is an acceptable error to display the landmarks on the images. Consequently, the pre-training of EB-Net is considered as correct and we have decided to re-use the pre-trained parameters values to fine-tune the model for beetle images.

\subsubsection{Fine-tuning on beetle images}
As we have mentioned, fine-tuning is a strategy of transfer learning that could boost the efficiency of a model on a target task. Technically, the weights of a CNN model can be fine-tuned by continuing the backpropagation, and it exists two ways to perform fine-tuning process: \textit{frozen} and \textit{unfrozen}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Frozen} scenario: the parameters of lower layers (close to the input layer) will be fixed, we fine-tune only the higher ones (close to the output layer).
	\item \textbf{Unfrozen} scenario: allows continuing to update the parameter values of all layers in the model.
\end{itemize}

In order to fine-tune EB-Net on beetle images, we have gone with unfrozen process to continue updating the parameter values. One can note that the sizes of images in the two datasets are different: the beetle images have a size of $256 \times 192$ pixels; whereas the size of facial images is $96 \times 96$ pixels, far from the beetle images. Consequently, adjustments are needed to match the two tasks.

First of all, reducing the resolution of the beetle images to $96 \times 96$ could be lead to a loss of essential information. As our images contain a background band, it is easy to suppress it with a pre-processing operation, we have chosen to remove a part of the background region (without any beetle's parts) instead of down-sampling our pictures. So, the new beetle images are finally set to $192 \times 192$ pixels. The EB-Net parameters will be settled to take into account the differences of the values between the pre-training and fine-tuning steps. To declare the modification, we set the stride value of the first convolutional layer to $2$ (as the usual way to do \cite{yosinski2014transferable}). 

\subsubsection{Fine-tuning results}
We present all the obtained results for the three beetle parts: pronotum, head and elytra, in the same way than in the previous results in order to provide an explicit comparison. Tables \ref{tblfn_pronotum}, \ref{tblfn_head}, \ref{tblfn_elytra} show the comparison at each position between the average distances provided by the two processes (training from scratch and fine-tuning) on pronotum, head, and elytra, respectively.  The first row presents the landmark number; \textbf{From scratch} row reminds the previously average distances when EB-Net has been trained from scratch; \textbf{Fine-tune} row presents the new average distances; the last row presents the improvement percentage between the two processes. The green and red values are respectively the best and the worst values in each process. All distances are given in pixel unity. In all these tables, all the average distances have decreased between $1$ and $1.5$ pixels in both of three sets of images. Clearly, the fine-tuning process has improved the landmark prediction for each group. The best-predicted positions (green ones) have changed but it exists a group of well-predicted landmarks in each set of images, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item For pronotum: the $1^{st}$, $3^{rd}$, and $7^{th}$ landmark.
	\item For head: the $6^{th}$, $7^{th}$, $8^{th}$, and $10^{th}$ landmark.
	\item For elytra: the $1^{st} - 5 ^{th}$, $10^{th}$, and $11^{th}$ landmark.
\end{itemize}

At the opposite side, the worst cases remain the same positions as previously: the $6^{th}$, $1^{st}$, and $8^{th}$ landmark on pronotum, head, and elytra, respectively.

	\label{tblfn_elytra}
\end{table}

Considering on each landmark position, the level of improvement is different depending on the difficulty of its location. But, all cases have been improved even they are the best or the worst cases. With the help of fine-tuning, the predictions have gained from $36.85\%/ 24.94\%/ 18.36\%$ to $19.18\%/ 12.15\%/ 12.82\%$ on pronotuom, head, and elytra, respectively.

As we have mentioned before, the mean value hides different situations when deeply going to the analysis. So, we have checked again these distribution of distances. Figure \ref{figchartpfn}, \ref{figcharthfn}, \ref{figchartefn} show the distribution of distances on two samples in each set of images: pronotum, head, and elytra, respectively. In these charts, the x-axis and y-axis present the number of images and the distance (in pixel). Each point in the chart represents a distance between manual and predicted landmarks, respectively. The blue/red lines in charts present the average values. We can observe from the figures that the distance values are very different from the two processes (training from scratch and fine-tuning). The distances have been reduced with the help of fine-tuning process whatever they were the low or the high values in the case of training from scratch. We have gained more points (in the chart) in the range from zero to the average one, and the number of extreme values have been decrease too. For example, in the worst case of pronotum (the $6^{th}$ landmark), we do not see any point greater than $15$ pixels with the fine-tuning process. However, it exists some difficult cases that the model could not optimize in the head or the elytra parts. These cases could be noted as the outlier values in our dataset.

\subsubsection{Predicted shapes : comparing 'from-scratch' to fine-tuning}

We have measured shape covariations between predicted landmarks and
manual ones \cite{rohlf_use_2000}, assessing the performance of
fine-tuned and `from scratch' networks (described previously) on each
anatomical parts. The shape covariation is expressed as a correlation
coefficient and an associated p-value.


\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{| c || c | c | c | c |}
		\hline
		  & \multicolumn{2}{ c |}{From scratch}  & \multicolumn{2}{ c |}{Fine-tune} \\ \cline{2-5}
		  & cor & p-value & cor. & p-v. \\ \hline
		\textbf{Pronotum} & 0.4118 & 0.001 & 0.7424 & 0.001 \\ \hline 
		\textbf{Head} & 0.5145 & 0.001 & 0.7337 & 0.001 \\ \hline 
		\textbf{Elytra} & 0.2513 & 0.407 & 0.3025 & 0.069 \\ \hline 
		%\textbf{Left mandible} & 0.2666 & 0.173 & 0.3112 & 0.057 \\ \hline 
		%\textbf{Right mandible} & 0.3071 & 0.239 & 0.4597 & 0.002 \\ \hline 
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Shape covariation between predicted and manual
          landmarks : shape covariation as a correlation coefficient
          (cor.) and the associated p-values (p-v.) }
        
	\label{tblfsft_comparing}
\end{table}

We can see from table \ref{tblfsft_comparing} that shape correlations
varies between $0.2513$ and $0.7424$ and that $4$ out of $6$ of them
are statistically significant (i.e. p-value $\le 0.001$). For all the
anatomical parts, the fine-tuning improved the shape correlations and
its statistical significance. Best results are obtained for fine-tuned
networks predicting pronotum's and head's  landmarks with high
significant correlations, $0.7224$ and $0.7337$
respectively. Fine-tuning enhanced predictions on Elytra but not
enough to make them usable. We end up with a majority ($\frac{2}{3}$)
of anatomical parts where the predicted landmarks are good candidate
for replacing manual ones in procrustes regressions.


\section{Discussion and perspectives}
In this article, we have presented a convolutional neural network, EB-Net, for automatically predict the landmarks on entomological images. It is based on three times the repetitions of a generic block followed by fully connected layers. The block consists of a convolutional layer, a max-pooling layer, and a dropout layer. In the first step, the EB-Net has been separately trained on each part of the beetles. In order to improve the results, the fine-tuning process has been added by pre-training EB-Net on a facial key-points dataset before transferring the parameter values to fine-tune on each set of images.

The results have been evaluated by calculating the distance between manual landmarks and predicted ones. These results have shown that using CNN to predict the landmarks on biological images leads to satisfying results without need for the complex pre or post processing steps on the studied objects. These predictions are statistically significant enough to replace manual landmarks in procrustes regression studies, which are fairly common in morphometric studies e.g. two classic methodological papers on the subject\cite{goodall_procrustes_1991,collyer_method_2015} have, respectively, direct citations of over one thousand and over a hundred \footnote{source Web of Science$^{TM}$ accessed on 04/24/2020}.

This work has addressed a complex task in computational biology: automatic landmark digitalization. The interest in this topic is not new, but the relevant algorithms and computational power have only been available fairly recently \cite{palaniswamy_automatic_2010,cintas_automatic_2017,vandaele_landmark_2018,dai_locating_2019}. Even so  most methods are seldom used by biologist and even so by entomologist. 
Maybe it is because the software tools are too complex and the necessary datasets not always available (e.g. too few training images and related manual landmarks).
We show here that a neural network with a relevant architecture can provide a high quality of results in only a few methodological steps. We took care of constructing this network using standard software tools to ease any technological transfer. Also, our model, EB-Net, can easily work with a limited number of images and improve its prediction results by fine-tuning the parameter values obtained from pre-training on another dataset.

Another interesting trait about automatic landmark digitalization is that it's a proxy to many different questions. While image-based insect classification (within or among species) \cite{martineau_survey_2017} serves a singular purpose, automatic generation of landmarks can help a variety of questions including regressions on (environmental) covariates, studies of shape-covariations, evaluation of phylogenetic signals and, of course, classification.

One can note that the elementary block that we used to build EB-Net, is generic so it's easy to adjust the suitable number of blocks for ones applications depending on the computing resources, as well as the expected results. For example, we have tried to add a new elementary block to EB-Net. The experiments have shown that the results have been slightly improved, but we have spent more resources and computing times to reach this improvement. The average distances have been improved by $0.5$ pixels. However, this change was statistically insignificant (data not shown). Consequently, we need to note that it exists a balance between the depth of the model, the accuracy of outputs and the cost to compute.
This elementary block approach is not, formally, a  neural architecture search \cite{elsken_neural_2019} i.e. a method for automating the design of a CNN,  but it is an easy to implement practical solution.

In this paper, we focused on a carabid species which is linked to studies in agroecology and conservation ecology. But EB-Net has the potential to be applied to other insects and invertebrates as well. In \cite{tatsuta_geometric_2018}, a bibliographic survey of articles published between $2000$ and $2015$ resulted in finding $472$ publications that used geometric morphometric methods to describe the shape of insects, with a linear $20$ fold increase of publications over the period and a bias toward a few orders of insects: Diptera, Coleoptera (as is the case here) and Hymenoptera. These $3$ orders encompass a of wide range of insects from pests (e.g. flies) to pollinators (e.g. bees). The range of applications for EB-Net is hence quite wide. In the near future, we also plan to test our model on datasets linked with sanitary issues notably invasive and quarantine species of nematods (ref colloque Romain) that are affecting Europe (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus) in the midst of the COVID-epidemics. 
To ease the use of our model, all the implementations, EB-Net model and EB-Net parameters, are available freely \footnote{\url{ https://github.com/linhlevandlu/cnnBeetles}} so it should possible to reuse EB-Net parameters for another landmark setting application and to apply transfer learning. We plan also to export EB-Net architecture to other application domains in biomedical imaging most notably MRI images analysis.

\subsubsection{Results on mandibles}
In previous work \cite{le2017maelab}, mandible images belonging to the same data set have been analyzed with the help of a pipeline of classical image analysis procedures and based on a segmentation step. We have evaluated the performances of EB-Net on this dataset. It is worth to note that the fine-tuning process has been applied for this experiment in the same way than the other parts: pre-training EB-Net with the facial key-points dataset and transferring the parameter values to fine-tune on mandibles.

To achieve the comparison, the obtained values in \cite{le2017maelab} have been re-computed to match the new size of the images by scaling these errors (distances) with the same ratio that we have used to down-sample images. Then, the average value has been computed for each landmark’s position. Figure \ref{figchartavgCompare} shows the comparison of average distance at each landmark position between the obtained results of the two methods (deep learning and image processing methods). The red curves illustrate the average distances which have been obtained from image processing technique while the blue curves present the results of fine-tuning process.

    \caption{These charts show the average distance on each landmark of all mandibles images.\\ The red, blue lines present the results from image processing and fine-tuning process, respectively.}
    \label{figchartavgCompare}
\end{figure}

For the right mandible (Figure \ref{figchartavgComparemd}), EB-Net has got better results than the image processing pipeline for all landmarks (except the first one). One can notice that the first position represent the tip of the shape, and it is easy to detect after a segmentation step. EB-Net works without segmentation, it is why the result for this point is similar to the other ones. Moreover, it is clear that the results of EB-Net exhibit of less variation than the previous method. For the left mandible (Figure \ref{figchartavgComparemg}), the pipeline has provided the worst results than for the right one. The hypothesis has been given that the size of this part varies more than the right one. On the opposite side, we can observe that EB-Net has produced results similar to the right one.

To summarize, the average value at each landmark position is better than the previous ones in both two cases: left and right mandibles, with the help of the fine-tuning process. The predictions are more stable and significantly improved: it has reduced the range between the highest and the lowest values in both of two sets, for example, from $6.85/ 7.66$ pixels to $2.17/ 2.13$ pixels for the left and right mandibles, respectively.



%This work has addressed a complex task in digital biology: automatized landmarks setting. We show that a neural network with a relevant architecture can provide an outstanding quality of results with reducing the number of steps. Our model, EB-Net, is one of them. The obtained results have pointed out that EB-Net easy to work on a limited number of images, and simply to improve results by fine-tuning the parameter values obtained from pre-training on another dataset.

%This work has addressed a complex task in digital biology: automatized landmarks setting. We show that a neural network with a relevant architecture can provide a high quality of results with reducing the number of steps. If training a network remains a costly operation, utilizing it is not time-consuming nor spends so much memory.
%Our model, EB-Net, has been built from elementary blocks and used to provide the landmarks on beetle images by applying two scenarios: training from scratch and fine-tuning process. The results have shown that our network architecture has worked effectively for predicting the landmarks. One can note that the model is independent of the segmentation step, it has analyzed the raw image through a sequence of elementary blocks before providing the location of landmarks. Moreover, the predictions have figured out that we have obtained better results with the help of the fine-tuning process. This point out that EB-Net is easy to work on a limited number of images, and simply to improve results by fine-tuning the parameter values obtained from pre-training on another dataset. It also shows the obtained results are more stable than the pipeline of image processing techniques.

One can note that the elementary block that we used to build EB-Net, is a generic one. It is easy to compose to build a network or even to remove a block from the model if the results are not satisfying. The users can select the suitable number of blocks for their applications depending on the computing resources, as well as the expected results. For example, we have tried to add a new elementary block to EB-Net. The experiments have shown that the results have been improved but not enough to justify the supplementary cost in resources or computing time.

All the implementations of EB-Net model and the pre-trained parameter values are available freely on the Github website \footnote{https://github.com/linhlevandlu/CNN\_Beetles\_Landmarks}. It is possible to download and to re-use them for another landmark setting application by training from scratch or applying transfer learning process.

% Remarkably, the fine-tuning has a great improvement at the positions located at parts that are hard to extract the contours. More, these results are stable on every landmark position. with image processing techniques, some first landmarks (from $1^{st}$ to $6^{th}$) have been well-predicted, which illustrated by small average values in the chart. However, these values begin to increase from the $7^{th}$ landmark. The reason is that the first group of events is mainly concentrated on the tip of the mandible where we can obtain the precise segmentation, while others are on the base where we can meet some difficulties to get the segment contours. For the fine-tuning process, the obtained values are more stable. Although some first values can be approximate or larger (from $2^{nd}$ to $7^{th}$ positions), other ones are better than the previous results (after $7^{th}$ position). Remarkably, the fine-tuning has a great improvement at the positions located at parts that are hard to extract the contours. More, these results are stable on every landmark position. 

\section{Conclusion}
In this article, we have presented a convolutional neural network, EB-Net, for automatic detection of landmarks on biological species. It is based on three times repeated of a generic block followed by the connected layers. The block consists of a convolutional layer, a max pooling layer, and a dropout layer. In the first step, the EB-Net has been separately trained on each part of beetles. In order to improve the results, the fine-tuning process has been added by pre-training EB-Net on a facial keypoints dataset from Kaggle before transfering the parameter values to fine-tune on each set of images.

The results have been evaluated by calculating the distance between manual landmarks and predicted ones. These results have shown that using CNN to predict the landmarks on biological images leads to satisfying results without need for segmentation step on the studied objects. These results have been valided by biologists in order to replace the manual task by the automatic one.

In future, we plan to test our model on different datasets owned by the INRA team, and to export EB-Net architecture for applying to other application domains studied in our team such as MRI images analysis, pose identification.

%For each set of images, different selections of data have been used to train, to validate, and to test the model. After training with the manual landmarks given by the biologist, the network is able to predict the landmarks on the set of unseen images. The results from the test set have been evaluated by calculating the distance between manual landmarks and corresponding predicted-landmarks. The average of distance errors on each landmark has been also considered. Using the convolutional network to predict the landmarks on biological images is promising good results in the case that the image can not be segmentation. The quality of prediction allows using automatic landmarking to replace manual landmarks in some aspects. In our case, the training dataset is limited. As a result, the accuracy of the network is acceptable. However, when we expect more about the accuracy of predicted landmarks (coordinates of predicted landmarks), the result of this work is still needed to improve (for example using a larger training dataset).

%In the second strategy to improve the results, EB-Net has been pre-trained on a facial keypoints dataset, then the parameter values have been transferred to fine-tune on each set of images. The predicted coordinates have been also evaluated by calculating the distance to manual ones. The results have shown that we have obtained the improvement in all cases of landmarks with the help of fine-tuning process. Therefore, future research in landmarking identification appears as an improved of the worth exploring.

%\subsection{Evalution metrics for further predicted landmarks usage}

%TODO \\

















%In this work, we have proposed a CNN network architecture for predicting landmarks in beetle images. The model is based on the concept of elementary block including a CONV layer, a Max POOL layer, and a Dropout layer. 

%With beetle mandibles images, the object is easy to segment and we have succeeded to determine the landmarks automatically. In opposite, the pronotum images are difficult to segment. Methods which not suppose to be based on segmentation are necessary. 




%For the right mandible (Figure \ref{figchartavgComparemd}), some first landmarks (from the $1^{st}$ to the $6^{th}$) have been well-predicted by the pipeline of image processing techniques. They are illustrated by the small average values in the chart (from $2.07$ pixels to $9.73$ pixels). However, these values begin increasing from the $7^{th}$ landmark and peak at the $14^{th}$ position. The reason is the first group of landmarks is mainly concentrated on the tip of the mandible where we can obtain the precise segmentation, while the others are on the base and we can encounter some difficulties to get the segment contours. For the fine-tuning process, all distances are better than the previous results (except the first one). The obtained values are more stable, and the variants between the results are not so large as in the previous one.

%For the left mandible (Figure \ref{figchartavgComparemg}), we obtain the similar situation than the right one. The obtained average values are more stable and better than the results coming from previous method (except the first one). One can note that the left mandibles are more difficult to process than the right ones by using image processing technique as discussed in \cite{le2017maelab}. The proof is that the values of the precise predictions (between $1^{st}$ and $8^{th}$) in the left mandibles are higher than the right ones. 

\section{Discussion}
In this work, we have proposed the elementary block as the based to build the CNN for predicting landmarks. It is worth to note that our block is a generic one. It is easy to add it, easy to test the model, even to remove a block from the model if the results are not satisfying. The users can choose suitable blocks for their applications. Choosing the number of blocks depends on the computing resources, as well as the expected results. For example, we have tried to add a new elementary block to EB-Net. The experiments have shown that the results have been improved, but we have spent more resources and computing times to reach this improvement. The average distances have been improved $0.5$ pixels. However, this change is insignificant if we show it on the images. Consequently, we need to note that it exists a balance between the depth of the model, the accuracy of outputs and the cost to compute.

\textbf{TODO}: on biological part.

As mentioned in section \ref{subsec21}, the mandible images have been taken after dissection, whereas the images of other parts have been captured before this process. In \cite{le2017maelab}, we have proposed a pipeline based on the segmentation step and applied to mandible images. The results have shown the pipeline has worked efficiently to provide the automatic landmarks on mandibles, but it could not be applied on the three parts of beetle: pronotum, head and elytra. It is why we have turned to utilize the CNN model for these three parts. In this experiment, we would like checking that if CNN work well to predict the landmark on mandible images. We have applied the fine-tuning process to mandible images in the same way than other parts. Then, we compare the obtained results between the two processes (fine-tuning and pipeline in \cite{le2017maelab}). 

In the five sets of beetle images, the mandibles are considered as easy to extract by using the image processing algorithms. In \cite{le2017maelab}, we have proposed a pipeline to estimate the landmarks in mandible images. In order to evaluate the effectivement of deep learning method and to compare with the obtained results from \cite{le2017maelab}, we have applied the fine-tuning process on mandible images in the same way as we have done on other parts. 

 In hyper-parameters side, we have increased the number of epochs to $10000$ but kept the same for other values as training from scratch. As the first step, we take into account the RMSE score to evaluate and to compare the effectiveness of EB-Net with other published scores in the challenge.



 The appearance of POOL layer after the CONV layer is a frequent occurrence in CNN \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet, ciregan2012multi, cintas2016automatic}. This work towards to two advantages: reducing the spatial size of the representation to decrease the number of parameters as well as saving the computing time, and to prevent the over-fitting during the training process. The dropout layer is usually inserted between the FC layers to prevent over-fitting as we have seen in the success stories \cite{lecun2015deep, krizhevsky2012imagenet}. But in our case, we have included them in the extracting features blocks (after pooling layers) to create some kinds of image noise augmentation. The objective of this work is to provide more studied cased in each training iteration. 




 Then, the computed results will be passed through the activation functions to provide the outputs. The second FC layer receives the outputs of the first FC layer as the input. The operations at this layer are the same than the first one. The third FC layer accepts the outputs of the second FC layer, then they will be used to compute the input.





In the content of this study, we work on pronotum part of beetle. The provided dataset contains 293 images, each image with 8 landmarks provided by biologists. The dataset was split into a training set with 260 images (training and validation) and a testing set of 33 images. During the training, the network learned the information through a pair of \textit{(image, landmarks)} in training set. At the testing phase, the image without landmarks was given to the trained network and the predicted landmarks will be given at the output. Fig. \ref{figpronotum} shows an example of pronotum image with its manual landmarks.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/pronotum}}
	\caption{An example of pronotum with manual landmarks}
	\label{figpronotum}
\end{figure}

In some succeed networks \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}\cite{sun2013deep}\cite{cintas2016automatic}, the maximum size of the inputs is not over 256 pixels. In our case, the resolution of the image is large, it becomes a difficulty for the network. During training and testing, the images are down-sampling to the new resolution of $256 \times 192$. Certainly, the landmark coordinates of the image are also scaled to suit their new resolution. 

The proposed network has a large number of learnable parameters. In addition, the size of the dataset is limited, this means that overfitting will occur during the training process. Therefore, we need to enlarge the size of the dataset. In image processing, we usually apply transform procedure (i.e rotate, translate) to generate a new image but in fact, when we compute the value of the pixels, it does not change while CNN computes the values of the pixels.Therefore, we have applied two other procedures to increase the number of images in the dataset. To address this problem, we have applied two procedures to enlarge the size of the dataset.

The first procedure was applied to change the value of each channel in the original image. According to this, a constant is added to a channel of RGB image and for each time, we just change the value of one of three channels. For example, from an original RGB image, if we add a constant $c = 10$ to the red channel, we will obtain a new image with the values at red channel by greater than the red channel of original image a value of 10. By this way, we can generate three new RGB images from a RGB image.

The second procedure is splitting the channels of RGB images. It means that we separate the channels of RGB into three gray-scale images. This work seems promising because the network works on single-channel images. At the end, we can generate six versions from an image, the total number of images used to train and validate is $260 \times 7 = 1820$ images (six versions and original image). The number of images that used for training and validation is splitted randomly by a ratio (training: $80\%$, validation: $20\%$) that has been set during the network setup.
