Morphometric analyses are revealing that development mediates complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors affecting shape. Evolution results from changes in those interactions, as natural selection favours shapes that more effectively perform some fitness-related functions. Quantitative studies of shape can characterize developmental and genetic effects and discover their relative importance. They integrate evo-devo and related disciplines into a coherent understanding of evolutionary processes from populations to large-scale evolutionary radiations.},

	abstract = {Feeding habits are important life-history traits in animals; however, methods for their determination are not well established in many species. The larvae of the beetle family Carabidae are an example. The present study tested the utility of geometric morphometrics of mouthpart morphology to infer the feeding habits of carabid larvae. Using Pterostichus thunbergi as a model system, larval feeding habits were inferred using geometric morphometrics of mouthparts and the results were compared with those obtained from rearing experiments. The rearing experiments indicated that P. thunbergi larvae are carnivores that require snails as an essential part of the diet. Through geometric morphometrics, associations between mouthpart morphology and larval feeding habits were confirmed for species in which these two traits are known. A discriminant analysis using these associations classified P. thunbergi larvae as snail/slug feeders, which is a result compatible with the rearing experiments. Geometric morphometrics also revealed that morphological integration and ontogenetic shape change might play roles in the diversification of mouthpart morphology. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of the geometric morphometrics of mouthparts to infer feeding habit and to clarify the mechanisms of mouthpart morphological diversification in the study group, and the results also serve as a basis for future studies of other insect groups.},

	abstract = {Migration and population dynamics are important in organisms that provide ecosystem services as they determine the occurrence of individuals in a given place at a given time, which, in turn, determines the efficiency of the service provided. To design appropriate landscape management strategies to improve the efficiency of biological control, it is essential to know the origin of beneficial insects that colonize agricultural fields. However, studying migration dynamics in insects is complicated by their small size and short life span which largely prevent the use of conventional techniques based on capture-mark-recapture, or remote sensing. Stable isotopes and morphological characters are intrinsic markers that can be used to infer the geographical origin of many organisms including insects. In this study, we first determined whether the hydrogen isotopic ratio and the wing morphometrics are appropriate markers to study the spring migration dynamics of a major aphidophagous hoverfly species (Episyrphus balteatus). To this end, we assessed the magnitude of variation of these indicators in seven populations along a north-south gradient in Western Europe. Second, we used the two markers in E. balteatus individuals collected in a French agricultural landscape over the course of the spring to assess the proportion of immigrants from southern regions and the period of immigration. Our results revealed uncertainties associated with the use of the hydrogen isotopic ratio and wing morphometrics, but showed that the spring population of E. balteatus in Western France very likely comprises mainly local individuals, with the probable arrival of some immigrants from nearby regions located further south.

	abstract = {This review article on carabids in sustainable agro-ecosystems of the temperate Northern hemisphere presents a compilation of the available knowledge on the significance of carabids for natural pest control and the effects of cultivation methods (except pesticides) and landscape structural elements. Field carabids are species rich and abundant in arable sites, but are affected by intensive agricultural cultivation. For sampling, fenced pitfall trapping or pitfall trapping is recommended according to the type of study. Many of the assumed beneficial pest control activities of carabids are still based on laboratory feeding records. In the field, carabids have been demonstrated to reduce cereal and sugar beet aphid populations in their early colonization phase, mainly by foraging on aphids that have fallen from the vegetation. Egg predation on Dipteran eggs, e.g. the cabbage root fly, has been overestimated in earlier literature. Scattered data indicate carabidforaging on certain coleopteran pest larvae. In North America, some evidence has been found for control of pest lepidopterans. Larger carabids, e.g. Abax parallelepipedus, can effectively control slugs in greenhouses. Because of their spermophagous feeding habits, certain species of Harpalus and Amara could have some potential for biological weed control. As a result of their sensitive reaction to anthropogenic changes in habitat quality, carabids are considered of bioindicative value for cultivation impacts. Carabids seem to be negatively affected by deep ploughing and enhanced by reduced tillage systems. No negative effects have been found for mechanical weed control and flaming. Carabid recruitment is enhanced by proper organic fertilization and green manuring. Intensive nitrogen amendment might indirectly affect carabids by altering crop density and microclimate. Field carabid assemblages are not bound to a certain crop type, but shift in dominance according to the crop-specific rhythmicity of cultivation measures and changes in crop phenology and microclimate. Crop rotation effects could also be influenced by field-size dependent recolonization capability of carabids. They are enhanced by crop diversification in terms of monocrop heterogeneity and weediness as well as by intercropping and the presence of field boundaries, although corresponding increases in their pest reduction efficacy have not yet been evidenced.},

	abstract = {Colophon is an understudied, rare and endangered stag beetle genus with all species endemic to isolated mountain peaks in South Africa’s Western Cape. Geometric morphometrics was used to analyse intersexual and interspecific variation of size and shape in the mandibles, heads, pronota and elytra of two sympatric species: Colophon haughtoni and Colophon kawaii. All measured structures showed significant sexual dimorphism, which may result from male-male competition for females. Female mandibles were too small and featureless for analysis, but male Colophon beetles possess large, ornate mandibles for fighting. Males had significantly larger heads and pronota that demonstrated shape changes which may relate to resource diversion to the mandibles and their supporting structures. Females are indistinguishable across species, but males were accurately identified using mandibles, heads and pronota. Male C. kawaii were significantly larger than C. haughtoni for all structures. These results support the species status of C. kawaii, which is currently in doubt due to its hybridisation with C. haughtoni. We also demonstrate the value of geometric morphometrics as a tool which may aid Colophon conservation by providing biological and phylogenetic insights and enabling species identification.},

	abstract = {* Many ecological and evolutionary studies seek to explain patterns of shape variation and its covariation with other variables. Geometric morphometrics is often used for this purpose, where a set of shape variables are obtained from landmark coordinates following a Procrustes superimposition.


* We introduce geomorph: a software package for performing geometric morphometric shape analysis in the r statistical computing environment.


* Geomorph provides routines for all stages of landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses in two and three-dimensions. It is an open source package to read, manipulate, and digitize landmark data, generate shape variables via Procrustes analysis for points, curves and surfaces, perform statistical analyses of shape variation and covariation, and to provide graphical depictions of shapes and patterns of shape variation. An important contribution of geomorph is the ability to perform Procrustes superimposition on landmark points, as well as semilandmarks from curves and surfaces.


* A wide range of statistical methods germane to testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses of shape variation are provided. These include standard multivariate methods such as principal components analysis, and approaches for multivariate regression and group comparison. Methods for more specialized analyses, such as for assessing shape allometry, comparing shape trajectories, examining morphological integration, and for assessing phylogenetic signal, are also included.


* Several functions are provided to graphically visualize results, including routines for examining variation in shape space, visualizing allometric trajectories, comparing specific shapes to one another and for plotting phylogenetic changes in morphospace.


* Finally, geomorph participates to make available advanced geometric morphometric analyses through the r statistical computing platform.},
